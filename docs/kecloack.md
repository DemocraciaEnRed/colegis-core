# Keycloak & DemocracyOS
Keycloak is a single sign on solution for web apps and RESTful web services. The goal of Keycloak is to make security simple so that it is easy for application developers to secure the apps and services they have deployed in their organization

To have in mind, we recommend the following articles from the docs:

- [System requirements](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_installation/index.html#system-requirements)
- [Section 3. Server administration](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#admin-console)

To understand about the concepts that Keycloak uses, read [this section](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/index.html#core-concepts-and-terms)
